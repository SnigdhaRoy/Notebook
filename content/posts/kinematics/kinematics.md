# What is physics?

It’s really difficult to define exactly what physics is. For one, physics keeps changing as we progress and make new discoveries. New theories don't just bring new answers. They also create new questions that might not have even made sense when viewed from within the previous theory of physics. This makes physics exciting and interesting, but it also forces attempts at defining physics into generalizations about what physics has been rather than what it might be at some point in the future.

Physicists are trying to do the following:

I. Precisely define the most fundamental measurable quantities in the universe (e.g., velocity, electric field, kinetic energy). The effort to find the most fundamental description of the universe is a quest that has historically always been a big part of physics.

II. Find relationships between those fundamental measured quantities (e.g., Newton’s Laws, conservation of energy, special relativity). These patterns and correlations are expressed using words, equations, graphs, charts, diagrams, models, and any other means that allow us to express a relationship in a way that we as humans can better understand and use. Math makes things simpler (Believe it or not, the principles, graphs, laws, and equations used in physics were not created to make explaining the universe more difficult; they are there to make it easier to explain the universe and precisely illustrate the patterns found within it. This might serve as little solace to a physics student struggling with a seemingly random and unrelated set of equations and definitions, but try to remember that underneath all of the intimidating and sometimes foreign-looking mathematical symbols, there is usually a simple conceptual idea. The math simply makes it possible to formulate a conceptual idea in a very precise and concise manner.)
