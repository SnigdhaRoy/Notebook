# What is physics?

It’s difficult to define exactly what physics is. For one, physics keeps changing as we progress and make new discoveries. New theories don't just bring new answers. They also create new questions that might not have even made sense when viewed from within the previous theory of physics. Although this is what makes physics so cool, it also forces attempts at defining physics into generalizations about what physics has been rather than what it might be at some point in the future.

So, I'll break down what physicists actually try to do: 

I. Precisely define the most fundamental measurable quantities in the universe (e.g., velocity, electric field, kinetic energy). The effort to find the most fundamental description of the universe is a quest that has historically always been a big part of physics.

II. Find relationships between those fundamental measured quantities (e.g., Newton’s Laws, conservation of energy, special relativity). These patterns and correlations are expressed using words, equations, graphs, charts, diagrams, models, and any other means that allow us to express a relationship in a way that we as humans can better understand and use. Math makes things simpler.

Trying to describe an extremely complex universe with clarifying laws is what physics is all about :D

# Let's define some key terms

Coordinate system - System we define to describe position. The origin is the point we label as zero. Coordinate systems also define directions for positive and negative numbers.

Position - Location of an object relative to the origin. We often use the symbol "x" to refer to position.

Displacement - The change in position of an object. We use the symbol Δx for displacement, where Δ means "change." A vector quantity with units of distance.

Distance - Total amount the object has moved. This depends on the whole path traveled, not just the starting and ending points. Distance traveled is always a non-negative number. A scalar quantity with units of distance.

Reference frame / frame of reference - A point of view from which measurements can be made. All frames of reference are equally valid.
